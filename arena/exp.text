this is my db schema , I have uploaded testData.py file which contains some data related to this schema I built to test this out. can you generate the data in schema format for all the 15 questions please. 

NOTE: createdAt, updateAt and id are automatically added, so need of that part, editorial is the main solution that our platform provides, solutions and submission is the part that other users submit, so no need to add that, the codeSnippets part must look some like this "
    "codeSnippet": "def mergeTwoLists( l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:\n    pass" where it has function definition, input and output with the type, need this for typescript and python,
" description contains the question description along with examples like this " Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
 

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?"
then the editorial looks something like this: "Two Sum

Approach 1: Brute Force
Algorithm

The brute force approach is simple. Loop through each element x and find if there is another value that equals to target−x.

Implementation


Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(n 
2
 ).
For each element, we try to find its complement by looping through the rest of the array which takes O(n) time. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n 
2
 ).

Space complexity: O(1).
The space required does not depend on the size of the input array, so only constant space is used.

Approach 2: Two-pass Hash Table
Intuition

To improve our runtime complexity, we need a more efficient way to check if the complement exists in the array. If the complement exists, we need to get its index. What is the best way to maintain a mapping of each element in the array to its index? A hash table.

We can reduce the lookup time from O(n) to O(1) by trading space for speed. A hash table is well suited for this purpose because it supports fast lookup in near constant time. I say "near" because if a collision occurred, a lookup could degenerate to O(n) time. However, lookup in a hash table should be amortized O(1) time as long as the hash function was chosen carefully.

Algorithm

A simple implementation uses two iterations. In the first iteration, we add each element's value as a key and its index as a value to the hash table. Then, in the second iteration, we check if each element's complement (target−nums[i]) exists in the hash table. If it does exist, we return current element's index and its complement's index. Beware that the complement must not be nums[i] itself!

Implementation


Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(n).
We traverse the list containing n elements exactly twice. Since the hash table reduces the lookup time to O(1), the overall time complexity is O(n).

Space complexity: O(n).
The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the hash table, which stores exactly n elements.

Approach 3: One-pass Hash Table
Algorithm

It turns out we can do it in one-pass. While we are iterating and inserting elements into the hash table, we also look back to check if current element's complement already exists in the hash table. If it exists, we have found a solution and return the indices immediately.

Implementation


Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(n).
We traverse the list containing n elements only once. Each lookup in the table costs only O(1) time.

Space complexity: O(n).
The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the hash table, which stores at most n elements." can you generate data in the given schema format for the first question in testdata.py
